    <p>
      We are the student chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
      club at the University of the Pacific. Our mission is to provide a
      community for engineers to come together and learn from each other and
      industry professionals as well as to work on cool projects. Our club has
      recently had a lively revival due new leadership and a very successful
      project of building a formula one car. Contact us if you are interested in
      joining. All majors are welcome!
